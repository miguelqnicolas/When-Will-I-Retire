            <p>Personal finance is something that is extremely interesting to me. It's a shame that some form of personal finance isn't taught in high schools today. I spend countless hours on the internet watching videos and reading articles, and I'd like to share some of that information with you all. I can't create a service like Mint or Credit Karma in a day, so I decided to focus on what I think is a critical idea that millenials need to think about - retirement. I hope this website allows you to think about other aspects of your personal finances and embarks your journey to a comfortable retirement!</p>
